Knowing issues ：
1.You should click the Override Post FX toggle in the Melody Render Pipeline component of the camera when first going into the scene.
2.Forward or Deferred Lit should be rendered with Option "Copy Depth" or "Use GBuffer" on and never run parallel.

Feature include ：
1.Base forward rendering path pipeline
2.Cascade shadow map
3.Directional light/Per object point light
4.Geometry buffer
5.Velocity buffer
6.Simple PBR
7.Complex toon shading
8.Post-processing stack: Bloom,color grading,outline,lightshift
9.Volumetric cloud
10.Atmosphere scattering
11.Screen-space ambient occlusion:SSAO,HBAO,GTAO
12.Screen-space Reflection
13.Temporal Antialiasing

VERY IMPROTANT:
Please let me know if you find bug in this project.
